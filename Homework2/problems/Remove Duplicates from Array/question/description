Remove duplicates are allowed at most twice in the given sorted array.

For example,
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3.

Note:
1. You may assume that array has enough space, the length of nums array is less than 100;
2. Each element in given array is less than 1000;
3. The outputs do not contain a newline (or line break '\n') in the end. 

INPUT:
6
1 1 1 2 2 3

OUTPUT:
5
1 1 2 2 3
