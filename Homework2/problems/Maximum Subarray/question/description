Maximum Subarray

Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6. 

Note:
1. You may assume that array has enough space, the length of array is less than 2000000;
2. Each element in given array is less than 1000;
3. The outputs do not contain a newline (or line break '\n').
