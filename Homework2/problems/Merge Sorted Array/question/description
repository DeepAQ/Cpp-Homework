Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
1. You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively;
2. The length of nums array is less than 100;
3. The outputs do not contain a newline (or line break '\n'). 

For example, given nums1=[1,2,3,4,5,6] with m=6, and nums2=[1,4,6,7] with n=4, the merged array is [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,7]

INPUT:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
4
1 4 6 7

OUTPUT:
1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 6 7
