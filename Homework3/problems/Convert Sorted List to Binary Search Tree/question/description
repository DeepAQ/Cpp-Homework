Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced BST. and its left sub tree is less shorter than then right one. then print the BST leaves from left to right.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which both the depth and the number of children of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.


INPUT
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

OUTPUT
1 4 6 9
