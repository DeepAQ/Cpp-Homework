Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue. 
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively. 

INPUT: 	6
		0 1 0 2 0 2
OUTPUT：0 0 0 1 2 2

注意：请不要修改main.cpp中的任何代码，将你的代码写在sort.cpp中
